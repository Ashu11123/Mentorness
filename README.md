## Predictive Modeling for Disease Classification

# Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories based on their health attributes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a reliable tool that healthcare providers can use to assist in disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Assignment Tasks:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore the structure of the dataset, including features and the target variable.
Perform data exploration to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values by either imputation or removal.
Check for outliers and decide on appropriate methods for handling them.
Encode categorical variables if present using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Engineering:

Analyze the significance of each feature in relation to the target variable using statistical tests or visualizations.
Create new features if necessary based on domain knowledge or feature interactions.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for binary classification, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Train the selected models on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model(s) using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance.
Interpretation and Validation:

Interpret the trained model(s) to understand feature importance and decision-making.
Validate the model(s) using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization.
